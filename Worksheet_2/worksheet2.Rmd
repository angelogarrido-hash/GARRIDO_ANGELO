# 1. Create a vector using : operator
# a. Sequence from -5 to 5
seq1 <- c(-5:5)
seq1

# b. x <- 1:7. What will be the value of x?
seq2 <- c(1:7)
seq2

# 2. Create a vector using seq() function
# a. seq(1, 3, by=0.2)
seq(1, 3, by=0.2)
# Output: 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0

# 3. Factory worker ages

# a. Access 3rd element
ages[3] # 3rd element is 22

# b. Access 2nd and 4th element
ages[2] # 2nd element is 28
ages[4] # 4th element is 36

# c. Access all but the 1st element
ages[-1]

# 4. Create a named vector x
x <- c("first" = 3, "second" = 0, "third" = 9)

# a. Print names and access elements
names(x)   # "first" "second" "third"
x[c("first", "third")]
# Output shows only "first" and "third"

# b. Print all and access selected
x

# Output: -3 0 -1 0 1 2

# Interpretation:
# J.K. Rowling's rank changed from 19 to 15.
# Her pay increased from 75 to 90.
# She became higher in ranking and earned more.
